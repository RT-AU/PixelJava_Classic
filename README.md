A retro-styled game experiment written in Java that simulates a "gameboy-esque" era of gaming.

The actual game is currently extremely limited in scope, as the main focus is on the idea of drawing the game screen within the larger handheld game console graphic, so that it simulates a real-world game console to some degree. Currently, the game includes a controllable character with movement animations.
Future development will likely focus on extending the gameplay itself to the point where other buttons (The classic Gameboy A and B, for example) can be used to interact with objects and NPCs.
